## Assessment Areas

### Area 1: Process Maturity

**Why It Matters:** Automation amplifies existing processes. Automating broken processes just makes them fail faster. Process maturity determines which workflows are automation-ready.

#### Questions (Score 0-3 for each)

**1.1 Process Documentation**
> Our core operational processes are documented with clear steps, owners, and expected outcomes.

*Why this matters:* You can't automate what you can't describe. Documented processes are 4x more likely to automate successfully.

**1.2 Process Standardization**
> Similar tasks across different teams/locations follow standardized procedures rather than individual approaches.

*Why this matters:* Standardization enables scaling. Custom processes require custom automation (expensive and fragile).

**1.3 Process Metrics**
> We track key metrics for our important processes (cycle time, error rate, cost per transaction, etc.).

*Why this matters:* You can't improve what you don't measure. Metrics prove ROI and identify improvement opportunities.

**1.4 Exception Handling**
> Our processes have defined procedures for handling exceptions and edge cases.

*Why this matters:* Automation works best for predictable workflows. Clear exception handling prevents automation breakage.

**1.5 Process Ownership**
> Each core process has a clear owner responsible for its performance and improvement.

*Why this matters:* Automation projects need champions. Process owners become automation advocates.

**1.6 Continuous Improvement Culture**
> Teams regularly review and improve processes rather than accepting "that's how we've always done it."

*Why this matters:* Organizations that optimize manually excel at automated optimization.

**Process Maturity Subtotal: _____ / 18 points**

#### Quick Win Opportunities (if score < 12):
- Document your top 3 most-repeated processes this month
- Standardize one high-volume process across teams
- Assign clear owners to your 5 most critical workflows

---

### Area 2: Data Infrastructure

**Why It Matters:** Automation requires data to flow between systems. Poor data infrastructure creates bottlenecks, errors, and failed automation projects.

#### Questions (Score 0-3 for each)

**2.1 Data Accessibility**
> Critical business data is accessible via APIs or structured databases, not locked in spreadsheets or PDFs.

*Why this matters:* APIs enable real-time automation. Manual data extraction kills ROI.

**2.2 Data Quality**
> Our data is generally accurate, complete, and consistent across systems (minimal duplicates or errors).

*Why this matters:* Automation relies on accurate data. Garbage in = garbage out (at scale).

**2.3 Single Source of Truth**
> For each key data type (customers, products, inventory, etc.), we have one authoritative system rather than multiple conflicting sources.

*Why this matters:* Multiple sources create sync issues. Automation can't resolve conflicting data automatically.

**2.4 Data Integration**
> Our systems can exchange data without manual exports/imports (even if integration is limited).

*Why this matters:* Existing integrations prove technical feasibility and reduce automation complexity.

**2.5 Master Data Management**
> We have consistent naming conventions, data formats, and standards across systems.

*Why this matters:* Data standardization enables cross-system automation. Inconsistent formats require constant manual mapping.

**2.6 Data Security & Compliance**
> We have clear data access policies and understand compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC 2, etc.).

*Why this matters:* Automation must respect security boundaries. Compliance violations can shut down projects.

**Data Infrastructure Subtotal: _____ / 18 points**

#### Quick Win Opportunities (if score < 12):
- Audit where your critical data lives (map the systems)
- Identify your biggest data quality issue and fix the root cause
- Connect your two most-used systems via native integration or Zapier

---

### Area 3: Team Readiness

**Why It Matters:** Technology is easy. People are hard. Team readiness determines whether automation gets adopted or abandoned.

#### Questions (Score 0-3 for each)

**3.1 Change Acceptance**
> Our team generally embraces new tools and process changes rather than resisting them.

*Why this matters:* Resistance kills automation ROI. Change-ready teams adopt 3x faster.

**3.2 Technical Capability**
> We have staff comfortable with technology, even if not developers (can learn new software, troubleshoot issues).

*Why this matters:* Someone must maintain automation. Non-technical teams struggle with ongoing management.

**3.3 Time for Transition**
> Teams have capacity to learn new systems without being completely overwhelmed by current workload.

*Why this matters:* Overworked teams can't absorb change. Automation requires upfront time investment.

**3.4 Automation Understanding**
> Leadership and teams understand what automation can (and can't) do realistically.

*Why this matters:* Unrealistic expectations doom projects. Clear understanding enables better scope decisions.

**3.5 Training Investment**
> We invest in training when implementing new systems rather than expecting people to "figure it out."

*Why this matters:* Proper training drives adoption. Self-taught teams make costly mistakes.

**3.6 Cross-Functional Collaboration**
> Teams from different departments work together effectively on shared initiatives.

*Why this matters:* Automation crosses departmental boundaries. Silos prevent end-to-end automation.

**Team Readiness Subtotal: _____ / 18 points**

#### Quick Win Opportunities (if score < 12):
- Survey teams about biggest pain points (build automation around their needs)
- Identify 2-3 "automation champions" (early adopters who influence others)
- Pilot one small automation with willing team before broader rollout

---

### Area 4: Technology Stack

**Why It Matters:** Your current tools determine automation complexity. Modern, API-first tools automate easily. Legacy systems require workarounds.

#### Questions (Score 0-3 for each)

**4.1 Cloud-Based Systems**
> Most of our core business systems are cloud-based SaaS rather than on-premise software.

*Why this matters:* Cloud systems offer better APIs and pre-built integrations. On-premise complicates automation.

**4.2 API Availability**
> Our critical systems offer APIs for programmatic access (even if we're not using them yet).

*Why this matters:* APIs enable automation. No API = manual workarounds or expensive custom development.

**4.3 Modern Tech Stack**
> Our core systems have been updated or replaced within the last 5 years.

*Why this matters:* Modern software is built for integration. Legacy systems often can't automate without replacement.

**4.4 Tool Consolidation**
> We've rationalized our tool stack (not using 5 different tools for similar purposes).

*Why this matters:* Tool sprawl multiplies integration complexity. Fewer tools = simpler automation.

**4.5 Integration Experience**
> We've successfully connected systems before (even with simple integrations like Zapier).

*Why this matters:* Past success proves capability and builds confidence for larger automation projects.

**4.6 Vendor Openness**
> Our software vendors support integration and provide good API documentation.

*Why this matters:* Vendor cooperation accelerates automation. Hostile vendors block progress.

**Technology Stack Subtotal: _____ / 18 points**

#### Quick Win Opportunities (if score < 12):
- Create inventory of all software tools and their integration capabilities
- Identify redundant tools and consolidate where possible
- Test one simple integration to prove concept (e.g., form submission → email notification)

---

### Area 5: ROI Potential

**Why It Matters:** Not all automation opportunities are created equal. ROI potential determines where to start and how to justify investment.

#### Questions (Score 0-3 for each)

**5.1 High-Volume Repetitive Tasks**
> We have processes repeated 50+ times per week that follow predictable patterns.

*Why this matters:* Volume drives ROI. High-frequency tasks deliver faster payback.

**5.2 Clear Cost Drivers**
> We can quantify the cost of manual processes (hours spent, error rates, delays caused).

*Why this matters:* Measurable costs enable ROI calculation. Vague benefits don't secure budget.

**5.3 Error-Prone Processes**
> Manual errors in our processes cause measurable problems (customer complaints, financial corrections, compliance issues).

*Why this matters:* Error reduction is often more valuable than time savings. Calculate rework costs.

**5.4 Bottleneck Identification**
> We know which manual processes slow down our operations and frustrate teams.

*Why this matters:* Bottleneck relief multiplies throughout the organization. Focus automation here first.

**5.5 Growth Without Headcount**
> We need to handle more volume but can't (or don't want to) hire proportionally more staff.

*Why this matters:* Automation enables scaling without linear cost increases. This is strategic ROI.

**5.6 Time-Sensitive Processes**
> We have workflows where speed matters competitively (customer response, order processing, etc.).

*Why this matters:* Speed improvements drive revenue. Calculate competitive advantage value.

**ROI Potential Subtotal: _____ / 18 points**

#### Quick Win Opportunities (if score < 12):
- List your top 10 most time-consuming manual processes
- Calculate true cost (hours × burden rate) of your top 3 processes
- Identify the one bottleneck that frustrates customers most

---

### Area 6: Change Management

**Why It Matters:** 70% of automation projects fail due to poor change management, not technical issues. Execution matters more than technology.

#### Questions (Score 0-3 for each)

**6.1 Executive Sponsorship**
> We have executive support for operational transformation and willingness to invest in improvement.

*Why this matters:* Executive air cover protects automation initiatives during rough patches. Budget approval depends on this.

**6.2 Clear Vision**
> Leadership has articulated why automation matters and what success looks like for our organization.

*Why this matters:* Vision drives adoption. Teams need to understand the "why" beyond efficiency.

**6.3 Communication Culture**
> We effectively communicate changes to teams and gather feedback throughout implementation.

*Why this matters:* Surprises breed resistance. Transparent communication builds trust and adoption.

**6.4 Success Measurement**
> We define success metrics before starting projects and track progress against them.

*Why this matters:* Undefined success leads to scope creep and perceived failure despite wins.

**6.5 Realistic Timelines**
> We set achievable project timelines with buffer for learning curves and unexpected issues.

*Why this matters:* Aggressive timelines guarantee failure. Realistic plans build credibility.

**6.6 Learning from Failures**
> We treat setbacks as learning opportunities rather than reasons to abandon initiatives.

*Why this matters:* All automation hits snags. Organizations that persist through problems win long-term.

**Change Management Subtotal: _____ / 18 points**

#### Quick Win Opportunities (if score < 12):
- Secure executive sponsor commitment before starting automation projects
- Create simple communication plan (who needs to know what, when)
- Define 3-5 specific success metrics for your first automation pilot
